# Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms
**Platforms Studied**: ChatGPT, Claude, Bard (Gemini), Cohere Command, and Meta AI  

---

## Abstract  

The year 2024 has seen rapid advancements in generative AI, with several major platforms offering prompting tools that serve diverse use cases. This report systematically evaluates five leading AI platforms—**ChatGPT, Claude, Bard (Gemini), Cohere Command, and Meta AI**—with the goal of identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal usage contexts.  

Through a controlled **use case** (summarizing technical articles and answering domain-specific questions), we compare performance across four critical dimensions: **accuracy, depth of response, creativity, and adaptability.** User experience is also examined through **interface design, prompting flexibility, latency, and limitations.**  

A structured algorithm was followed, including identical prompts across platforms, systematic recording of outputs, and human evaluation using a rubric-based scoring system. The findings reveal distinct comparative advantages: **ChatGPT** excels in accuracy and structure, **Claude** offers nuanced reasoning and creativity, **Bard/Gemini** provides engaging phrasing but oversimplifies, **Cohere Command** delivers concise responses, and **Meta AI** is highly accessible but often shallow in technical depth.  

This evaluation provides insights for researchers, educators, and practitioners on choosing the right platform for specific tasks.
